          <h2><a name="3.1">3.1 Working with Menus</a></h2><a name="3.1"></a> Menus provide a list of commands that you can
          execute.<br />
          <br />

          <center>
            <img src="guide/images/menu.gif" border="0" width="480" height="300" alt="[An Example Menu]" />
          </center><br />
          <br />
          To execute a command listed in a menu, click in the corresponding item. The item will blink telling that the command is
          going to be executed.<br />
          <br />
          Grayed commands are disabled and cannot be executed at that moment. If you click on them nothing will happen.<br />
          <br />
          Some menu entries have a little triangular indicator at the right. Selecting these entries will open a submenu, with a
          new list of commands.<br />
          <br />
          You can use the keyboard to traverse and execute commands in some of the menus. First you must hit the key used to open
          the menu --- like F12 for the root menu --- to enable keyboard traversal of it. Then you can use the Up and Down arrow
          keys to change the current selected item and the Left and Right arrow keys to jump between submenus and parent menus.
          To execute the current selected item press Return. To close the menu or stop menu traversal, press Escape.
          Additionally, pressing the first letter for an menu item, will jump the current selection to that item.<br />
          <br />
          You can make frequently used menus ``stick'' to the workspace by dragging the titlebar of the menu. This will make a
          close button appear in the menu titlebar. If you want to close the menu, just click in that button.<br />
          <br />
          Menus are normally placed on top of other windows and cannot be obscured by them. If you want the menus to be able to
          be obscured by lowering them, double click the menu titlebar while holding the Meta key. Repeat this to make the menus
          not obscurable again.<br />

          <h3><a name="3.1.1">3.1.1 The Root Window Menu</a></h3><a name="3.1.1"></a> The <i>Root Window Menu</i> or
          <i>Applications Menu</i> has items that allow you to quickly launch applications and do some workspace
          management.<br />
          <br />
          To open this menu, click on the workspace (root window) with the 3rd mouse button or hit the key bound to it (F12 by
          default).<br />
          <br />
          The contents of the applications menu can be configured to hold the applications installed on your system. To learn how
          to configure it, read the section on application menu configuration.<br />

          <h3><a name="3.1.2">3.1.2 The Window List Menu</a></h3><a name="3.1.2"></a> Clicking in the workspace with the middle
          mouse button will open a menu listing all windows that currently exist, with the workspace in which the window is
          located to its right. The current focused window is marked by a diamond sign next to its name. Clicking in an entry in
          this menu will focus the window, raise it, and change to the workspace where it is located.<br />
          <br />
          <br />

          <a name="3.2"></a>

          <h2><a name="3.2">3.2 Working with Applications</a></h2><a name="3.2"></a> In WindowMaker the instance of a running
          application is represented by an application icon. Do not confuse it with the icons (miniwindows in WindowMaker)
          displayed by other window managers when a window is iconified. Application icons and miniwindows can be differentiated
          in that miniwindows have titlebars, application icons do not.<br />
          <br />
          WindowMaker identifies a group of windows as belonging to a single instance of an application through some standard
          hints that the application sets in its windows. Unfortunately, not all applications that exist set these hints,
          preventing some application-specific features from working. These hints are <b>WM.CLASS</b>,<b>WM.COMMAND</b>, and
          <b>WM.CLIENT.LEADER</b> or the group leader in <b>WM.HINTS</b>.<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <font size="-1">Note: The information about applications contained in this section only applies to versions of
          WindowMaker built without the --enable-single-icon compile time option. This option is unsupported and behaviour when
          it's enabled will not be covered in this text.</font><br />

          intend to use it later you can <i>hide</i> it. When you hide an application all windows and miniwindows that belong to
          that application will be removed from the screen and hidden into its application icon.<br />

          can store frequently used applications for easy and fast access. It is located, by default, on the right side of the
          screen.<br />
          <br />
          You can click the top icon (the one with the GNUstep logo) and drag it downward to remove most of the dock from view.
          You can also drag it sideways to move the entire dock from side of the screen to the other.<br />
          <br />
          A menu similar to the <a href="chap3.php#3.2.2">application icon
          menu</a> is brought up when you click a docked icon with the right mouse button.<br />
          <br />
          To make the dock <i>float</i> over windows (not be coverable by windows), either double-click the top dock icon while
          holding the Meta key, or select the "Floating Dock" option in the dock menu.<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Starting a docked application</b><br />
          <br />
          To start an application that is docked, double-click its icon. The icon will be briefly highlighted and the application
          will start.<br />
          <br />
          While an application is not running an ellipsis is present in the lower left-hand corner of the icon. This ellipsis
          will disappear when the application is started and reappear when the application is exited.<br />
          <br />
          While the application is running the docked icon will behave just like a normal, undocked application icon, except for
          some extra actions specific to the dock.<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <font face="Helvetica"><b>To start a docked application:</b></font>

          <br />
          If a new instance of an already running application is started it will get a new application icon.<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Customizing the dock</b><br />
          <br />
          To add new applications to the dock, you can click an application icon and drag it onto the dock. When a ghost image of
          the icon appears you can release the mouse button and the icon will be docked.<br />
          <br />
          To reorder the docked applications, drag an icon to an empty slot and move the icons around as you want.<br />
          <br />
          To remove a docked application, drag it from the dock and release the mouse button when the ghost image disappears. To
          remove the icon of an application that is running, hold the Meta key while dragging it.<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Configuring the docked application</b><br />
          <br />
          To change the settings of a docked application, select the "Settings..." item in the dock menu for that icon. A
          settings panel for that icon will appear.<br />
          <br />

          <center>
            <img src="guide/imagdockapppanel.gif" border="0" width="297" height="369" alt="[Docked Application Settings Panel]" />
          </center><br />
          <br />
          In the <i>Application path and arguments</i> field, the path for the application and its arguments can be changed. Note
          that you can't change the application that is represented in the icon or change anything that would cause the
          application name to be changed. For example, if the icon is for <b>xterm</b> you can't change the field's value to
          <b>ghostview</b>; or if the icon is for <b>xterm -name vi</b>, you can't change it to <b>xterm -name pine</b>. Also
          note that you cannot use shell commands, such as out put redirectors. (&gt;, &gt;&gt; etc.)<br />
