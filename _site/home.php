          <h3>Introduction</h3>

          <p><strong>Window Maker</strong> is an X11 window manager originally designed to provide integration support for the
          <a href="http://gnustep.org">GNUstep</a> Desktop Environment. In every way possible, it reproduces the elegant look and
          feel of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEXTSTEP">NEXTSTEP</a> user interface. It is fast, feature rich, easy
          to configure, and easy to use. It is also free software, with contributions being made by programmers from around the
          world.</p>

          <p>Window Maker has a stable user interface since many years and comes with a powerful GUI configuration editor called
          WPrefs, which removes the need to edit text-based config files by hand. It supports running <a href=
          "http://www.dockapps.net">dockapps</a> which make everyday tasks such as monitoring system performance and
          battery usage, mounting devices or connecting to the internet very easy. Please see the <a href=
          "features.php">features</a> section for more specifics on what Window Maker can do, and how it compares with other
          popular window managers.</p>
