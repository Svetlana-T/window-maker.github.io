Please use only Window Maker standard directory sructures. This means don't 
       stick your titlebars in a directory under "~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/Titlebars"
       and your Tiles under "~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/Tiles". Please use 
       <tt>~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/Pixmaps</tt> for all tiles and menu/titlebar images,   
       <tt>~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/Icons</tt> for any icons you include
       and <tt>~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/Backgrounds</tt> for your backgrounds.
